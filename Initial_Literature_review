Generative Models for Technical Image Understanding § [May 2025 – Present] Dr. Ashutosh Modi

• Working as a student researcher on the project for the interpretation of technical diagrams using Vision Language Models(VLMs).
• Contributed to the real-world dataset of the project by manually creating more than 30 flow chart images and authoring 150+
Mermaid codes for graph and flow chart diagrams to serve as ground-truth data.
• Explored the application of Denoising Diffusion Models for synthetic data generation, analyzing their current limitations and
potential for creating realistic, hand-drawn-style technical images.
• Currently developing a novel generative model to synthesize images that accurately reflect the variations found in real-world,
hand-drawn diagrams.
• Tech Stack: Python, PyTorch, Generative AI (Diffusion Models), Mermaid.js, Computer Vision.
